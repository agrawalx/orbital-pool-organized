## Introduction

> **Orbital Pool isn‚Äôt just another AMM, it‚Äôs a paradigm shift. The future holds a million stablecoins. Today's infrastructure isn't ready.**

Orbital is an automated market maker for pools of 2, 3, or 10,000 stablecoins. It unlocks capital efficiency by bringing concentrated liquidity to higher dimensions.

By bending liquidity into a torus-shaped universe, Orbital unlocks concentrated liquidity for three or more stablecoins at once. This isn‚Äôt your usual 2D liquidity grid‚Äîit‚Äôs an entirely new dimension where LPs can laser-focus around the $1 mark, while still guaranteeing fair prices even if an entire stablecoin depegs.

It‚Äôs like Uniswap V3‚Äôs surgical precision colliding head-on with Curve‚Äôs bulletproof stability, and the result is something that shouldn‚Äôt even exist, but somehow, it does.

Orbital is the AMM where capital efficiency doesn‚Äôt just scale, it warps!

## Key Features

- **Multi-Token Stability Engine**: Seamlessly trade across three or more stablecoins in a single pool with no more fragmented liquidity.
- **Warped Concentrated Liquidity**: Liquidity providers can laser-focus capital around $1, achieving maximum efficiency while still keeping markets resilient.
- **Torus Invariant Model**: A breakthrough mathematical invariant that curves liquidity across dimensions, ensuring fair pricing even in extreme scenarios.
- **Boundary-Aware Swaps**: Swaps automatically handle transitions between interior and boundary regions, ensuring correct pricing even at the edge of the liquidity surface.
- **Fusion of Giants (Uniswap √ó Curve)**: Orbital takes Uniswap V3‚Äôs precision and Curve‚Äôs stability, merging them into a next-generation AMM.
- **Powered by Arbitrum Stylus + Rust**: Our entire mathematical engine runs in Rust via Stylus, unlocking performance and gas efficiency for complex calculations.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Orbital Model

The Orbital AMM is built on the mathematical foundation described in the [Paradigm Orbital Whitepaper](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/06/orbital). The core innovation lies in extending concentrated liquidity to higher dimensions using spherical geometry.

#### Core Mathematical Concepts

**1. Sphere AMM Formula**

<img src="images/orbital_equation.png" width="400" alt="Orbital Equation" /> 

Where:
- `r(vector) = (r, r, ..., r)` vector is the center of the sphere
- `x·µ¢` is the AMM's reserve of asset i
- `r` is the radius of the sphere

**2. Torus Invariant**

The pool uses a torus (donut-shaped) invariant that combines:
- **Interior Ticks**: Behave like spheres for normal trading
- **Boundary Ticks**: Behave like circles when reserves hit boundaries

**3. Newton's Method**

Implementation of newton's method in Stylus contract to solve torus invariant with multiple fallback¬†strategy.

**4. Q96X48 Implementation** 
We utilize the Q96X48 fixed-point arithmetic format, where the lower 48 bits represent the fractional component and the upper 96 bits represent the integer component.

**5. Tick Geometry**

Each tick is defined by:
- **k**: Plane constant (tick identifier)
- **r**: Radius of the tick
- **Status**: Interior or Boundary
